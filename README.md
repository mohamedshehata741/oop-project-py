## Project Title: Personal Library Management System 
#### Project Description: For this project, you will be building a Personal Library Management System using the Python programming concepts you've learned so far. This system will allow users to manage their personal book collection, add new books, remove books, search for books, and store information about each book.
Project Requirements:

Class Definitions:

Create a class named Book to represent a book with attributes like title, author, genre, and publication year.
Create a class named Library to represent the personal library. This class should have methods to add a book, remove a book, search for a book by title or author, and display the entire library.
Data Structure:

Use appropriate data structures like lists, dictionaries, or sets to store and manage the collection of books in the library.
File Handling:

Implement methods in the Library class to save and load the library data to/from a text or CSV file. This will ensure that the library data is persistent across different program executions.
Exception Handling:

Implement exception handling to handle potential errors gracefully. For instance, handle cases where a book is not found, a file is not found, or input validation errors occur.
User Interaction:

Create a user-friendly command-line interface that allows users to interact with the library. Provide options to add a book, remove a book, search for a book, and display the entire library.
